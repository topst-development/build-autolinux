Autolinux
=========

Description
-----------
The AutoLinux was developed to make it easy to download and build the SDK.
It does not provide all settings and functions, so you should refer to the Manual for detailed configurations.

Cloning
=======
Set up build-autolinux by cloning its Git repository:

     git clone ssh://git@github.com/topst-development/build-autolinux.git

Prerequisites
=============
Before you can build, you will need set variable.
If you already installed buildtools and downloaded source-mirror , you can save download time by setting some variables.

    $ cd build-autolinux
    $ vi template/sdk.py

SOURCE_MIRROR = ''	#set your downloaded source mirror path
BUILDTOOL = ''		#set your installed buildtools path

Configuration
=============
To configure the build and to fetch the sources:

    $ ./autolinux -c configure

The configure sequence the following:
(The step is activated only when there is at least one selectable case)
	- Choose a SDK to download
	- Choose a Manifest to download
	- Choose a Machine to build
	- Choose a Features to build

When configure is finished, you can see the result.
ex)
	SDK=tcc8050_linux_ivi_tost
	MANIFEST=tcc8050_linux_ivi_tost_0.1.0.xml
	MACHINE=tcc8050-main
	VERSION=dev
	FEATURES=with-subcore

Build
=====
Enter the command ‘build’ to start the build.
The menu is activated only when there is at least one selectable case. The command ‘build is same to ‘bitbake’
To kick off a full build of SDK, make sure you have at least 50GB of disk space available and enter the following:

    $ ./autolinux -c build

Create a build image the following path:
	build/tcc8050-main/tmp/deploy/images/tcc8050-main/
	build/tcc8050-sub/tmp/deploy/images/tcc8050-sub/
	cr5-bsp/sources/build/tcc805x/
	
This may take in the neighborhood of two hours on a multi-core workstation with a fast disk subsystem and lots of memory,
or many more hours on a laptop with less memory and slower disks or in a VM.

If you need more information about the Autolinux, please enter '--help' option.

Make Firmware Image
===================
Enter the command ‘make_fai’ to make SD Data.fai(for fwdn). This Command valid only main-core's image

    $ ./autolinux -c make_fai

Create a SD Data.fai the following path:
	build/tcc8050-main/tmp/deploy/fwdn/

FWDN 
====
Enter the command to download image at the following path: 
	boot-firmware/tools/fwdn/

	$ ./fwdn.sh

Cleaning
========
The clean command is related to remove build history and cache data.

	- default : move current built files to recycle directory. Recycle directory path : build/delete
		$ ./autolinux -c clean

	- old     : delete recycle directory.
		$ ./autolinux -c clean old

	- all     : Delete entire build directory including build history. Atfer clean all, rebuilding for the first time has a long build time.
		$ ./autolinux -c clean all

	- main     : Delete main core build directory including build history.
		$ ./autolinux -c build main clean
	
	- sub     : Delete sub core build directory including build history.
		$ ./autolinux -c build sub clean
	
	- cr5     : Delete cr5 core build directory including build history.
		$ ./autolinux -c build cr5 clean

Modify
======
The modify command modifies an already configured autolinux.config file.
	Machine : modify machine. If machine changed, The select feature menu is automatically activated
	Feature : modify feature
	Sub-feature : modify sub-feature. For modify sub-feature to be possible, The feature must include a ‘with-subcore’.
	Image : modify image. The menu is activated only when there is at least one selectable case.

		$ ./autolinux -c modify (feature/sub-feature)

Devtool
=======
Devtool is available in AutoLinux through devtool command.
	$ ./autolinux -c devtool (devtool command)
